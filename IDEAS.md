# Parked ideas — do not build during the 14 days

## Parked from Day 1
- Slim the Docker image (aspnet base + Chromium only, drop Firefox/WebKit)
- Railway region is EU West — revisit if monitoring Saudi stores
- Playwright instance is created per request; pool it if load grows
- Solution uses the new .slnx format; may break older CI tooling
- Install Docker Desktop locally when Postgres/Hangfire need it

## Parked from Day 3
- Endpoints lack Produces<T>() so Swagger shows "Undocumented" for
  non-200 responses
